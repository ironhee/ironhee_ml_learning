Because [Rust's deep learning ecosystem is not mature enough](https://www.arewelearningyet.com/), the models in this project are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).


## Setup

1. [Setup tensorflow environment](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
1. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
